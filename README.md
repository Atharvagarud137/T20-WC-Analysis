# T20 World Cup 2022 Analysis using Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and data for the analysis of the T20 World Cup 2022 using machine learning techniques. The T20 World Cup is a prestigious international cricket tournament held every four years, where teams from different countries compete in the shortest format of the game.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of teams in the T20 World Cup 2022 using machine learning techniques. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends in team performance, identify key factors that influence success in the tournament, and make predictions about the outcomes of matches.

## Data
The analysis is based on historical data from previous T20 World Cups, including match results, team statistics, player performances, and other relevant data. The data has been collected from various sources and has been preprocessed for analysis.

## Methodology
The analysis will be performed using Python programming language and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib. The following steps will be followed:
* Data preprocessing: The raw data will be cleaned, filtered, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis. Missing values, duplicates, and outliers will be handled appropriately.
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA): The cleaned data will be analyzed using various statistical techniques and visualizations to gain insights into team performance, player performance, and other relevant factors.
* Feature engineering: New features will be created from the existing data to capture relevant information and improve the predictive power of the models.
* Results and conclusions: The findings of the analysis will be summarized, and conclusions will be drawn based on the results. Recommendations for teams and players to improve their performance in the T20 World Cup 2022 will be provided.

## Requirements
The code in this repository requires the following libraries to be installed in the Python environment:
* Python 3.x
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy

The data used for analysis is included in the repository, but additional data may be required for specific analyses or predictions.

## Usage
To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries listed in the 'Requirements' section.
- Navigate to the 'notebooks/' directory and open the Jupyter notebooks.
- Follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the code for data preprocessing, EDA, and model development.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project presents an in-depth analysis of the T20 World Cup 2022 using machine learning techniques. Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model development, we have gained insights into team performance, player performance, and key factors that influence success in the tournament.
The findings of this analysis can be used to inform teams and players on strategies to improve their performance in the T20 World Cup 2022. The developed predictive models can also be used to make predictions about match outcomes and assist in decision-making during the tournament.
It is important to note that the accuracy and reliability of the models depend on the quality of the data and the assumptions made during analysis. Further refinement and validation of the models may be necessary as more data becomes available.
Overall, this project serves as a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts, data analysts, and cricket teams looking to leverage machine learning for analyzing and predicting performance in the T20 World Cup 2022.
